## Put comments here that give an overall description of what your
## functions do

# Matrix inversion is usually a costly computation and there may be some
# benefit to caching the inverse of a matrix rather than computing it
# repeatedly (there are also alternatives to matrix inversion that we will
# not discuss here). Your assignment is to write a pair of functions that
# cache the inverse of a matrix.

## Write a short comment describing this function

##This function creates a special "matrix" object
##that can cache its inverse.

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
  m<-NULL
  set<-function(y){
    x<<-y
    m<<-NULL
  }
  get<-function() x
  setinverse<-function(inverse) m<<-inverse
  getinverse<-function() m
  list(set=set,get=get,setinverse=setinverse,
       getinverse=getinverse)
  ##print(x)

}


## Write a short comment describing this function

# This function computes the inverse of the special
# "matrix" returned by `makeCacheMatrix` above. If the inverse has
# already been calculated (and the matrix has not changed), then
# `cacheSolve` should retrieve the inverse from the cache.

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
  m <- x$getinverse()
  if(!is.null(m)){
    message("getting cached data")
    return(m)
      }
  data <- x$get()
  m <- solve(data, ...)
  x$setinverse(m)
  m
}
